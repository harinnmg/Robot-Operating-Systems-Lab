# Python Codes for practice

Role of python in robot programming: In robotics applications, Python is commonly preferred where less computation is required, such as writing data to a device using serial communication protocols, logging data from a sensor, creating a user interface, and so forth.. 
Python in ubundu: Go to terminal and type python3 and python 
Install the same if not installed by the command sudo apt-get install python python3 
Two ways to do python programming 
1.	Python interpreter 
2.	Python scripts and running using interpreter 

# First program: 

```
Print(“hello world”) 
```
# Python scripts: 
Following are the steps to write a python script 
1.	Open a notepad file 
2.	Add first line #! usr/bin/env python3 
3.	Type Print(“hello world”) 
4.	Save it with .py extension 
5.	Check the file is executable 
6.	Run the file with prefix python3 file.py 
# Fundamentals of python 
1.	Dynamic typing 

Python is a dynamic typing language, which means that we don’t need to provide the data type of a variable during programming; it takes each variable as an object. We can assign any kind of data type to a name A=10 and A= ‘10’ will work. 

2.	Code indentation 

Indentation is simply the tab or white space prior to a line of code. In C++, we may use indentation to group a block of code, but it is not mandatory. The C++ code compiles even if we are not keeping any indentation, but it is different in Python. We should keep the block of code in the same indent; otherwise, it shows an indentation error. When indentation is mandatory, the code looks neat and readable. 

3.	Semicolon: Not mandatory 

4, Python variables: Tuples,lists, and dictionaries 

a.	List:- in square brackets eg: 
```
a=[1,2,3] 
```
b.	Tuples: In round brackets, not editable  
```
a=(1,2,3)
```
c.	Dictionary: Curly brackets  
```
c={“a”:1,”b”:2} 
Print(c.keys()): [‘a’,’b’] Print(c.values()): [1,2] 
```
